        <h2>I am Shavawn Simmons.</h2>

        <div class = "about-para">
          <p>Shavawn Peterson Simmons has been a resident of Clayton County, Georgia since 2005. She is a transplant from South Florida, born and raised in the Miami, Dade County community. A product of educator parents, her education lineage goes deep: three generations!   Simmons is a proud Fisk University (Nashville, Tennessee) alumnus. After earning her Bachelor of Science degree in Business Management, Simmons worked for Armstrong Cork Corporation, First Chicago, and Xerox Corporation before earning her Master’s degree in Advertising from Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois.</p>
          <p>Realizing that the corporate life was not for her, she returned to her South Florida roots and began her career as a professional educator. “I remember deciding to apply to teach. I really wanted to prepare kids for the world of work! My transcript gave me an in of all places as a teacher of English!”  She continues, “My personal goal under all the grammar and literature was to help kids develop their soft skills. I felt that if they could present themselves well, they would have a leg-up on the competition. English standards would be their in!”</p>
          <p>Now 26 years later, and retired, Simmons feels the same way! She has used her corporate experience as leverage to developing Family Literacy of Georgia, Inc. , a 501C3 organization with the mission to boost literacy among families with a particular emphasis on adolescent youth.  By identifying what teens like to do and using their interest as the hook to teach the skills necessary for success in the world of work! Her focus: communication skills. </p>
          <p>Mrs. Simmons has melded her corporate experience with her passion for literacy and teens as a Magnet Coordinator for Communications and Broadcast Arts, an Assistant Principal for Workforce Development, and a Literacy Coach for middle school. Her self-proclaimed niche continues to be as a classroom teacher! There in her “incubator of life” she can mold children to become their best selves. </p>
          <p>After 26 years and thousands of kids later, she continues to make an impact on the lives of America’s youthful assets here in Georgia. </p>
