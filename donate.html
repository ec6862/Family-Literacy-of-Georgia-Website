                The Family Literacy of Georgia proliferates literacy among Black, Latin American, and other minorities who aren't exposed to opportunities. We provide kids with books and offer a variety of programs for them to interact and learn. One of our major goals is to provide award-winning and engaging books to children at no cost. Along with books, we hope to organize little libraries for kids to have unlimited access to. To make all this possible, we ask for you to donate.
 
<p class = "text">A donation as little as <b>$20</b> will ensure that a child gets to read tonight. Your donation will serve to create opportunities that will enhance minorities further in education. According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, 32 percent of fourth-graders and 24 percent of eighth-graders aren’t reading at a basic level. And fewer than 40 percent are proficient or advanced. Your donation will allow these kids lacking financially to gain the access to knowledge. You will be aiding a student to become a future doctor, engineer, pilot, nuclear scientist, etc.</p> 
 
<p class = "text">At Family Literacy of Georgia, we believe in proactiveness. We believe that in order to bring change, one must tackle the issue. In order to support our cause in increasing literacy in the United States, we implore you to donate.</p>
