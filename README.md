Hello, this is a project I've done during my senior year in high school under an internship. I've done this project with two other colleagues, but as of now, do not have their Github account information to properly give credibility. If you have done this project with me, please let me know and I'll ensure that you receive the credit that you deserve. As I am also new to Github while writing this, please note that the website is not currently completed fully, as some files are too large and I do not know how to properly integrate it onto Github. To access the proper webpage, please use this link instead.

Otherwise, this is all I have for this website. Thank you.
